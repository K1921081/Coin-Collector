# Coin Collector
Platformer game written in C++ using the SDL2 library (https://libsdl.org). Contains a CMake file that can be used to generate projects for different systems. This project has been tested on Windows 10 and Linux.

The game starts out in the main menu which has three buttons: Play Game, which starts the game; Instructions, which opens another menu that describes the controls and how the game is player; and Quit - which closes the game. The game itself includes a character which is controlled with the keyboard, is affected by gravity and has collision and bounds testing. There are three coins that need to be collected to win the game. To collect a coin, the player needs to collide with one. When all thre coins are collected, the game goes to a Game Won scene, which has the text "YOU WIN!" and a button to go back to the main menu.
